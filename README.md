In response to survey of EU Developers earnings published on HN few days ago (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15088840), I made a v1 of a dashboard and would love to hear some feedback on what info would You like to see on first sight, dig deeper.. or whatever is Your prime interest from this survey (like which country pays the most, or smth else?)

I worked on this around 5-6h, and I am curious what are some tricks to improve it overall or make some things slicker, please share Your thoughts.. 

I am planning to build a portfolio of few real data visualization cases, so any help is really appreciated as to how to improve overall skills.
